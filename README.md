Hi, I'm Prajeeta — a First-Year Computer Science Engineering student with a growing passion for robotics, communication, and coding.
I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real-world problems, and I’m skilled in programming languages like Python, C, and C++. I’ve also worked as a Business Development Analyst at Younity, where I honed my communication and strategic thinking skills. As I build my journey in tech, I’m always excited to collaborate, learn, and create meaningful solutions at the intersection of innovation and impact.
